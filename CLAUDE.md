## Development

### Git Workflow

- use rebase for git pull
- git commit message should prefix with gitmoji
- git branch name format example: tj/feat/feature-name
- use .github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md to generate pull request description

### Package Management

This repository adopts a monorepo structure.

- Use `pnpm` as the primary package manager for dependency management
- Use `bun` to run npm scripts
- Use `bunx` to run executable npm packages

### TypeScript Code Style Guide

see @.cursor/rules/typescript.mdc

### Modify Code Rules

- **Code Language**:
  - For files with existing Chinese comments: Continue using Chinese to maintain consistency
  - For new files or files without Chinese comments: MUST use American English.
    - eg: new react tsx file and new test file
- Conservative for existing code, modern approaches for new features

### Testing

Testing work follows the Rule-Aware Task Execution system above.

- **Required Rule**: `testing-guide/testing-guide.mdc`
- **Command**:
  - web: `bunx vitest run --silent='passed-only' '[file-path-pattern]'`
  - packages(eg: database): `cd packages/database && bunx vitest run --silent='passed-only' '[file-path-pattern]'`

**Important**:

- wrapped the file path in single quotes to avoid shell expansion
- Never run `bun run test` etc to run tests, this will run all tests and cost about 10mins
- If try to fix the same test twice, but still failed, stop and ask for help.

### Typecheck

- use `bun run type-check` to check type errors.

### i18n

- **Keys**: Add to `src/locales/default/namespace.ts`
- **Dev**: Translate `locales/zh-CN/namespace.json` locale file only for preview
- DON'T run `pnpm i18n`, let CI auto handle it
